  <p style="font-size:1.6rem;max-width:900px;margin:1.5rem auto;">Cybersecurity Awareness for Small Business Staff</p>
  <p style="max-width:1150px;margin:0 auto;">In today’s digital business landscape, cyber threats evolve faster than ever. So, cybersecurity awareness is necessary for small business and their staff because attackers often target smaller organisations with limited resources by exploiting human mistakes like weak passwords or clicking on phishing emails. A single slip can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, or even business closure, but simple habits such as using strong passwords, updating software, and spotting suspicious messages can make a huge difference. By empowering every employee to take responsibility, small businesses not only protect customer trust and sensitive data but also build resilience and ensure long-term success in today’s digital-first world.</p>

     <h2 style="text-align:center;color:var(--pri);margin-top:3rem;">Why Cybersecurity Matters to  Blue Horizon</h2>
  <p style="max-width:1150px;margin:2rem auto;">Blue Horizon Office Supplies, with its 25 employees, manages sensitive customer data, supplier bank details, invoices, and internal communications, making cybersecurity a vital part of everyday operations. A single phishing email or weak password could disrupt workflows, cause financial loss, damage hard-earned customer trust, and even expose staff information. Because attackers often target small businesses with limited resources, every employee, whether in sales, finance, admin, or warehouse, plays a direct role in safeguarding the organisation. Cybersecurity awareness empowers staff to recognise threats, take confident action, and embed simple habits like strong passwords, cautious email handling, and timely software updates into daily routines. By building a workplace culture where security is second nature, Blue Horizon not only protects its people and data but also strengthens resilience, reduces risk, and ensures long-term success in a digital-first business world.</p>
