    <h2>Why Social Engineering Awareness Matters</h2>
    <p>Social engineering awareness matters because attackers frequently exploit human trust rather than technical flaws, using deception to trick staff into revealing confidential information, approving fraudulent payments, or granting access to systems and facilities. Unlike malware or hacking tools, these attacks rely on persuasion, urgency, or impersonation, making them harder to detect with technology alone. By learning to recognise manipulation tactics—such as fake authority, urgent requests, or overly friendly approaches employees can pause, verify, and respond safely. Embedding awareness into daily routines empowers staff to protect sensitive data, financial resources, and workplace integrity, ensuring that the organisation’s strongest defence is not just its technology, but its people.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Research & Critical Insight</h2>
    <p><li>Social engineering ranks among the most common and effective attack methods because it exploits human behaviour, not software (Gitnux, 2024).</li><br>
    <li>“Human error” remains the top cause of breaches (Huntress, 2025).</li><br>
    <li>Attackers commonly start with a social engineering attempt, then escalate using stolen access (Evolution Systems, 2024).</li><br></p>
    <p><strong>Critical Insight:</strong> A culture of verification “trust but verify” reduces the power of social manipulation.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Business Relevance & Practicality</h2>
    <p> At Blue Horizon, the combination of a warehouse and office environment introduces unique risks, as delivery drivers and external visitors regularly enter the premises and staff often share desks and devices. These everyday interactions create opportunities for attackers to exploit physical access or unattended systems, making social engineering and insider threats more likely. Practical measures such as issuing visitor badges, requiring sign‑ins, and encouraging staff to lock screens when stepping away are simple, low‑cost steps that significantly reduce exposure. By embedding these habits into daily routines, Blue Horizon strengthens both physical and digital security, protects sensitive customer and supplier information, and ensures that staff can work confidently without disrupting operations or incurring major expenses.</p>

    <h2>Actionable Guidance for Staff</h2>
    <p><strong>Social Engineering Red Flags:</strong> Requests for secrecy or urgency, pressure to bypass procedures, calls requesting password help, requests to change bank details.</p>
    <p><strong>Physical Security Practices:</strong><br>• Lock your screen every time you step away<br>• Secure confidential documents<br>• Report unfamiliar people<br>• Never leave devices unattended</p>
